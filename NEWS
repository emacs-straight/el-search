Some of the user visible news were:


Version: 1.7

  Signature and semantics of non-interactive function
  `el-search-forward' have been further adapted to that of the vanilla
  search function `search-forward'.  The counterpart
  `el-search-backward' has been added.

  The new key bindings < and > let you directly jump to the first and
  to the last match in a buffer.

Version: 1.6.5

  When the new user option `el-search-allow-scroll' is enabled (the
  default), scrolling doesn't deactivate the current el-search.
  Unlike isearch you can scroll the current match offscreen - use
  `el-search-jump-to-search-head' (C-J or M-s e j when using the
  suggested key bindings) to jump back to the current match.

Version: 1.6.1

  New function `el-search-looking-at', the el-search version of
  `looking-at'.

Version: 1.5.2

  The new command `el-search-to-register' allows to save the current
  search (including its state) to a register and later make that
  search current again with `jump-to-register' (C-x r j).

Version: 1.5.1

  The new command `el-search-ibuffer-marked-buffers' el-searches the
  marked buffers in *Ibuffer*.

Version: 1.5

  The new function `el-search-install-bindings-under-prefix' can be
  used to install repeatable versions of the el-search commands under
  a prefix key.

Version: 1.4.0.15

  The new option value 'ask-multi for el-search-auto-save-buffers,
  which is also the new default, makes el-search only prompt for
  whether to save buffers for multi-buffer query-replace sessions.
  For single buffer sessions, no prompt, and you can/should save
  yourself.  I find that behavior slightly more convenient than 'ask
  in most cases.
