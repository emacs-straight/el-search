;;; Commentary:

;; This package implements an expression based interactive search tool
;; for Emacs Lisp files and buffers.  The pattern language used is a
;; superset of `pcase' patterns.
;;
;; "el-search" is multi file/buffer search capable.  It is designed to
;; be fast and easy to use.  It offers an occur-like overview of
;; matches and can do query-replace based on the same set of patterns.
;; All searches are added to a history and can be resumed or restarted
;; later.  Finally, it allows you to define your own kinds of search
;; patterns and your own multi-search commands.
;;
;;
;; Key bindings
;; ============
;;
;; Loading this file doesn't install any key bindings - but you
;; probably want some.  There are two predefined sets of key bindings.
;; The first set installs bindings mostly of the form
;; "Control-Shift-Letter", e.g. C-S, C-R, C-% etc.  These can be
;; installed by calling (el-search-install-shift-bindings) - typically
;; in your init file.  For console users (and others), the function
;; `el-search-install-bindings-under-prefix' installs bindings of the
;; form PREFIX LETTER.  If you e.g. call
;;
;;   (el-search-install-bindings-under-prefix [(meta ?s) ?e])
;;
;; you install bindings M-s e s, M-s e r, M-s e % etc.  When using
;; this function to install key bindings, the bindings are
;; "repeatable" where it makes sense, so that you can for example hit
;; M-s e j s s s a % to reactive the last search, go to the next match
;; three times, then go back to the first match in the current buffer,
;; and finally invoke query-replace.
;;
;; Here is a complete list of key bindings installed when
;; you call
;;   (el-search-install-shift-bindings)
;; or
;;   (el-search-install-bindings-under-prefix [(meta ?s) ?e])
;;
;; respectively:
;;
;;   C-S, M-s e s (el-search-pattern)
;;     Start a search in the current buffer/go to the next match.
;;
;;   C-R, M-s e r (el-search-pattern-backward)
;;     Search backward.
;;
;;   C-%, M-s e % (el-search-query-replace)
;;     Do a query-replace.
;;
;;   M-x el-search-directory
;;     Prompt for a directory name and start a multi search for all
;;     Emacs-Lisp files in that directory.  With prefix arg,
;;     recursively search files in subdirectories.
;;
;;   C-S, M-s e s in Dired (el-search-dired-marked-files)
;;     Like above but uses the marked files and directories.
;;
;;   C-S, M-s e s in Ibuffer (el-search-ibuffer-marked-buffers)
;;     Search marked buffers in *Ibuffer*.
;;
;;   C-O, M-s e o (el-search-occur)
;;     Pop up an occur buffer for the current search.
;;
;;   C-O or M-RET (from a search pattern prompt)
;;     Execute this search command as occur.
;;
;;   C-N, M-s e n (el-search-continue-in-next-buffer)
;;     Skip over current buffer or file.
;;
;;   C-D, M-s e d (el-search-skip-directory)
;;     Prompt for a directory name and skip all subsequent files
;;     located under this directory.
;;
;;   C-A, M-s e a, M-s e < (el-search-from-beginning)
;;     Go back to the first match in this buffer or (with positive
;;     prefix arg) completely restart the current search from the
;;     first file or buffer.
;;
;;     With negative prefix arg, or with >, go to the last match in
;;     the current buffer.
;;
;;   C-J, M-s e j (el-search-jump-to-search-head)
;;     Resume the last search from the position of the last visited
;;     match, or (with prefix arg) prompt for an old search to resume.
;;
;;   C-H, M-s e h (el-search-this-sexp)
;;     Grab the symbol or sexp under point and initiate an el-search
;;     for other occurrences.
;;
;;   M-x el-search-to-register
;;     Save the current search to an Emacs register.  Use C-x r j
;;     (`jump-to-register') to make that search current and jump to
;;     the latest position.
;;
;;
;; The setup you'll need for your init file is trivial: just define
;; the key bindings you want to use (all important commands are
;; autoloaded) and you are done.
;;
;;
;; Usage
;; =====
;;
;; The main user entry point `el-search-pattern' (C-S) is analogue to
;; `isearch-forward'.  You are prompted for a `pcase'-style search
;; pattern using an `emacs-lisp-mode' minibuffer.  After hitting RET
;; it searches the current buffer from point for matching expressions.
;; For any match, point is put at the beginning of the expression
;; found (unlike isearch which puts point at the end of matches).  Hit
;; C-S again to go to the next match etc.
;;
;; Syntax and semantics of search patterns are identical to that of
;; `pcase' patterns, plus additionally defined pattern types
;; especially useful for matching parts of programs.  The (only)
;; difference to the `pcase' macro is that the expressions found in
;; buffers and files are tried to be matched instead of a given
;; expression.
;;
;; It doesn't matter how code is actually formatted.  Comments are
;; ignored, and strings are treated as atomic objects (their contents
;; are not being searched).
;;
;;
;; Example 1: if you enter
;;
;;    97
;;
;; at the prompt, el-search will find any occurrence of the integer 97
;; in the code, but not 97.0 or 977 or (+ 90 7) or "My string
;; containing 97" or symbol_97.  OTOH it will find any printed
;; representation of 97, e.g. #x61 or ?a.
;;
;;
;; Example 2: If you enter the pattern
;;
;;   `(defvar ,_)
;;
;; you search for all `defvar' forms that don't specify an init value.
;;
;; The following pattern will search for `defvar's with a docstring
;; whose first line is longer than 70 characters:
;;
;;   `(defvar ,_ ,_
;;      ,(and (pred stringp)
;;            s
;;            (guard (< 70 (length (car (split-string s "\n")))))))
;;
;; Put simply, el-search is a tool to match representations of
;; symbolic expressions written in a buffer or file.  Most of the
;; time, but not necessarily, this is Elisp code.  El-search has no
;; semantic understanding of the meaning of these s-exps as a program.
;; For example, if you define a macro `my-defvar' that expands to
;; `defvar' forms, the pattern `(defvar ,_) will not match any
;; equivalent `my-defvar' form, it just matches any lists of two
;; elements with the first element being the symbol `defvar'.
;;
;; You can define your own pattern types with `el-search-defpattern'
;; which is analogue to `defmacro'.  See C-h f `el-search-pattern' for
;; a list of predefined additional pattern types, and C-h f pcase for
;; the basic pcase patterns.
;;
;; Some more pattern definitions can be found in the file
;; "el-search-x" which is part of this package but not automatically
;; loaded.
;;
;;
;; Multi Searching
;; ===============
;;
;; "el-search" is capable of performing "multi searches" - searches
;; spanning multiple files or buffers.  When no more matches can be
;; found in the current file or buffer, the search automatically
;; switches to the next.  Examples for search commands starting a
;; multi search are `el-search-buffers' (search all living elisp mode
;; buffers), `el-search-directory' (search all elisp files in a
;; specified directory), `el-search-emacs-elisp-sources' (search all
;; Emacs elisp sources) and `el-search-dired-marked-files'.  Actually,
;; every search is internally a multi search.
;;
;; You can pause any (multi) search by just doing something different
;; (no quitting is needed), the state of the search is automatically
;; saved.  You can later continue searching by calling
;; `el-search-jump-to-search-head' (C-J): this command jumps to the
;; last match and re-activates the search.

;; `el-search-continue-in-next-buffer' (C-N) skips all remaining
;; matches in the current buffer and continues searching in the next
;; buffer.  `el-search-skip-directory' even skips all subsequent files
;; under a specified directory.
;;
;;
;; El-Occur
;; ========
;;
;; To get an occur-like overview buffer, you can use the usual
;; commands to initiate a search.  You can either hit C-O from a
;; pattern prompt instead of RET to confirm your input and start the
;; search as noninteractive occur search.  Alternatively, you can
;; always call `el-search-occur' (C-O) to start an occur for the
;; latest started search.
;;
;; The *El Occur* buffer uses an adjusted emacs-lisp-mode.  RET on a
;; match gives you a pop-up window displaying the position of the
;; match in that buffer or file.  With S-tab you can (un)collapse all
;; file sections like in `org-mode' to see only file names and the
;; number of matches, or everything.  Tab folds and unfolds
;; expressions (this uses hideshow; initially, all expressions are
;; folded to one line) and sections at the beginning of headlines.
;;
;;
;; Multiple multi searches
;; =======================
;;
;; Every search is collected in a history.  You can resume older
;; searches from the position of the last match by calling
;; `el-search-jump-to-search-head' (C-J) with a prefix argument.  That
;; let's you select an older search to resume and switches to the
;; buffer and position where this search had been suspended.
;;
;;
;; Query-replace
;; =============
;;
;; You can replace expressions with command `el-search-query-replace'.
;; You are queried for a pattern and a replacement expression.  For
;; each match of the pattern, the replacement expression is evaluated
;; with the bindings created by pattern matching in effect, and
;; printed to a string to produce the replacement.
;;
;; Example: In some buffer you want to swap the two expressions at the
;; places of the first two arguments in all calls of function `foo',
;; so that e.g.
;;
;;   (foo 'a (* 2 (+ 3 4)) t)
;;
;; becomes
;;
;;   (foo (* 2 (+ 3 4)) 'a t).
;;
;; This will do it:
;;
;;    M-x el-search-query-replace RET
;;    `(foo ,a ,b . ,rest) RET
;;    `(foo ,b ,a . ,rest) RET
;;
;; Type y to replace a match and go to the next one, r to replace
;; without moving, SPC or n to go to the next match and ! to replace
;; all remaining matches automatically.  q quits.  And ? shows a quick
;; help summarizing all of these keys.
;;
;; It is possible to replace a match with more than one expression
;; using "splicing mode".  When it is active, the replacement
;; expression must evaluate to a list, and is spliced into the buffer
;; for any match.  Use s from the prompt to toggle splicing mode in an
;; `el-search-query-replace' session.
;;
;;
;; Multi query-replace
;; ===================
;;
;; To query-replace in multiple files or buffers at once, call
;; `el-search-query-replace' directly after starting a search whose
;; search domain is the set of files and buffers you want to treat.
;; Answer "yes" to the prompt asking whether you want the started
;; search drive the query-replace.  The user interface is
;; self-explanatory.
;;
;; It is always possible to resume an aborted query-replace session
;; even if you did other stuff in the meantime (including other
;; `el-search-query-replace' invocations).  Since internally every
;; query-replace is driven by a search, call
;; `el-search-jump-to-search-head' (maybe with a prefix arg) to make
;; that search current, and invoke `el-search-query-replace' (with the
;; default bindings, this would be C-J C-% or C-x o j %).  This will
;; continue the query-replace session from where you left.
;;
;;
;; Advanced usage: Replacement rules for semi-automatic code rewriting
;; ===================================================================
;;
;; When you want to rewrite larger code parts programmatically, it can
;; often be useful to define a dedicated pattern type to perform the
;; replacement.  Here is an example:
;;
;; You heard that in many situations, `dolist' is faster than an
;; equivalent `mapc'.  You use `mapc' quite often in your code and
;; want to query-replace many occurrences in your stuff.  Instead of
;; using an ad hoc replacing rule, it's cleaner to define a dedicated
;; named pattern type using `el-search-defpattern'.  Make this pattern
;; accept an argument and use it to bind a replacement expression to a
;; variable you specify.  In query-replace, specify that variable as
;; replacement expression.
;;
;; In our case, the pattern could look like this:
;;
;;   (el-search-defpattern el-search-mapc->dolist (new)
;;     (let ((var  (make-symbol "var"))
;;           (body (make-symbol "body"))
;;           (list (make-symbol "list")))
;;       `(and `(mapc (lambda (,,var) . ,,body) ,,list)
;;             (let ,new `(dolist (,,var ,,list) . ,,body)))))
;;
;; The first condition in the `and' performs the matching and binds
;; the essential parts of the `mapc' form to helper variables.  The
;; second, the `let', part, binds the specified variable NEW to the
;; rewritten expression - in our case, a `dolist' form is constructed
;; with the remembered code parts filled in.
;;
;; Now after this preparatory work, for `el-search-query-replace' you
;; can simply specify (literally!) the following rule:
;;
;;   (el-search-mapc->dolist repl) -> repl

;;
;;
;; Known Limitations and Bugs
;; ==========================
;;
;; - Replacing: in some cases the read syntax of forms is changing due
;;   to reading-printing.  "Some" because we can handle this problem
;;   in most cases.
;;
;; - Similar: comments are normally preserved (where it makes sense).
;;   But when replacing like `(foo ,a ,b) -> `(foo ,b ,a)
;;
;;   in a content like
;;
;;     (foo
;;       a
;;       ;; comment
;;       b)
;;
;;   the comment will be lost.
;;
;; - Something like (1 #1#) is unmatchable (because it is un`read'able
;;   without context).
;;
;; - In el-search-query-replace, replacements are not allowed to
;;   contain uninterned symbols.
;;
;; - The `l' pattern type is very slow for very long lists.
;;   E.g. C-S-e (l "test")
;;
;; - Emacs bug#30132: 27.0.50; "scan-sexps and ##": Occurrences of the
;;   syntax "##" (a syntax for an interned symbol whose name is the
;;   empty string) can lead to errors while searching.
;;
;; - In *El Occur* buffers, when there are adjacent or nested matches,
;;   the movement commands (el-search-occur-previous-match,
;;   el-search-occur-next-match aka n and p) may skip matches, and the
;;   shown match count can be inaccurate.
;;
;;
;; TODO:
;;
;; - There should be a way to go back to the starting position, like
;;   in Isearch, which does this with (push-mark isearch-opoint t) in
;;   `isearch-done'.
;;
;; - Add a help command that can be called while searching.
;;
;; - Make searching work in comments, too? (->
;;   `parse-sexp-ignore-comments').  Related: should the pattern
;;   `symbol' also match strings that contain matches for a symbol so
;;   that it's possible to replace occurrences of a symbol in
;;   docstrings?
;;
;; - Port this package to non Emacs Lisp modes?  How?  Would it
;;   already work using only syntax tables, sexp scanning and
;;   font-lock?
;;
;; - Replace: pause and warn when replacement might be wrong
;;   (ambiguous reader syntaxes; lost comments, comments that can't
;;   non-ambiguously be assigned to rewritten code)
;;
;; - There could be something much better than pp to format the
;;   replacement, or pp should be improved.

(defun el-search-heuristic-matcher (pattern)
  "Return a heuristic matcher for PATTERN.

A heuristic matcher is a predicate accepting two arguments.  The
first argument is a file name or buffer.  The second argument is
a thunk (see \"thunk.el\") of a list of all of this file's or
buffer's atoms, or of the atoms of a defun (i.e. top-level
expression) in this file or buffer.  The predicate returns nil
when we can be sure that this file or buffer or defun can't
contain a match for the PATTERN, and must return non-nil else.

The idea behind heuristic matching is to speed up searching
without altering the matching behavior by discarding files or
buffers or defuns that can't contain a match.  Most search
patterns contain non-ambiguous information about properties of
atoms that must be present in a buffer or defun containing a
match, and computing a list of atoms is negligibly fast compared
to searching that buffer or defun directly.  Thus we spare
expensively searching all buffers and defuns we can sort out that
way.

When specified in an `el-search-defpattern' declaration, a
MATCHER-FUNCTION should be a function accepting the same
arguments ARGS as the defined pattern.  When called with ARGS,
this function should return either nil (meaning that for these
specific arguments no heuristic matching should be performed and
normal matching should be used) or a (fast!) function, the
\"heuristic matcher\" for this pattern, that accepts two
arguments: a file-name or buffer, and a thunk of a complete list
of atoms in that file or buffer or of a defun in it, that returns
non-nil when this file or buffer or defun could contain a match
for the pattern (NAME . ARGS), and nil when we can be sure that
it doesn't contain a match.  \"Atom\" here means anything whose
parts aren't searched by el-searching, like integers or strings,
but unlike arrays (see `el-search--atomic-p').  When in doubt,
the heuristic matcher function must return non-nil.

When el-searching is started with a certain PATTERN, a heuristic
matcher function is constructed by recursively destructuring the
PATTERN and combining the heuristic matchers of the subpatterns."

Buffers and files are separated by headlines.  Matches are

expressions are folded to one line.
\\<el-search-occur-mode-map>
Clicking on a file or buffer name displays it in a different
window and goes to the first match.
\\[el-search-occur-jump-to-match] on a match displays that match
in its buffer.  \\[revert-buffer] refreshes the buffer and
restarts the search.  \\[hs-toggle-hiding] folds and unfolds
expressions, while \\[el-search-occur-cycle] folds and unfolds
buffer and file sections like in `org-mode'.  At the beginning of
a headline, <tab> toggles folding the following section.

Hit \\[quit-window] to leave without killing the buffer.

The occur buffer is in `el-search-occur-mode' that is derived
from `emacs-lisp-mode' and `special-mode'.  In addition it makes
use of `hs-minor-mode' and `orgstruct-mode'."

  "Replace some matches of \"el-search\" pattern FROM-PATTERN.

TO-EXPR is an Elisp expression that is evaluated repeatedly for
each match with bindings created in FROM-PATTERN in effect to
produce a replacement expression.  Operate from point
to (point-max).

As each match is found, the user must type a character saying
what to do with it.  For directions, type ? at that time.

As an alternative to enter FROM-PATTERN and TO-EXPR separately,
you can also give an input of the form

   FROM-PATTERN -> TO-EXPR

\(\">\" and \"=>\" are also allowed as a separator) to the first
prompt and specify both expressions at once.  This format is also
used for history entries.

When called directly after a search command, use the current
search to drive query-replace (like in isearch).  You get a
multi-buffer query-replace this way when the current search is
multi-buffer.  When not called after a search command,
query-replace all matches following point in the current buffer.

It is also possible to replace matches with an arbitrary number
of expressions (even with zero expressions, effectively deleting
matches) by using the \"splicing\" submode that can be toggled
from the prompt with \"s\".  When splicing mode is on (default
off), the replacement expression must evaluate to a list, and all
of the list's elements are inserted in order.

The optional argument TEXTUAL-TO is bound by the interactive form
to the text form of the replacement expression specified.  It is
consulted to construct the text form of each replacement."
